## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project delivers a professional, recruiter-ready dashboard which predicts customer churn in a telecom setting. It spans **data ingestion**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, **deployment** via Streamlit and a polished report-style UI.  
It is designed to showcase the full lifecycle: from raw data → ML model → interactive web app.

---

## 🎯 Key Features  

- Pipeline for **data ingestion**, processing and transformation (tenure, charges, z-score, groups)  
- Trained machine learning model (RandomForest / XGBoost) to estimate churn probability  
- Interactive Streamlit application where business users input customer data and receive prediction & probability  
- Executive dashboard visualising KPI metrics, churn rates by contract/internet type, CLV distribution and trends  
- Deployment ready — public app link, GitHub repo for code and artifacts

## 📥 Live App  
Access the live deployed app here:  
[Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard](https://alizarkhan62--end-to-end-ml-project-custom-streamlit-app-0sdl14.streamlit.app/)

Feel free to try it, input sample data, and observe churn risk predictions.

## 🧰 Installation & Setup  

**Prerequisites**  
- Python 3.10 (recommended)  
- Git  

**Steps to run locally**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlizarKhan62/-End-to-End-ML-Project-Customer-Churn-Predition.git  
cd -End-to-End-ML-Project-Customer-Churn-Predition  
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
streamlit run streamlit_app.py  
````

**To deploy on Streamlit Cloud**

1. Ensure the `runtime.txt` exists with `python-3.10`
2. Push the repo to GitHub
3. On [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io), select your repo → branch `main` → `streamlit_app.py` → Deploy

---

## 🧮 How It Works

1. User enters customer details (gender, tenure, contract type, charges etc).
2. Input is encoded and scaled using `label_encoders.pkl` & `scaler.pkl`.
3. Model (`best_model.pkl`) predicts churn probability and classifies as “Churned” or “Active”.
4. Results shown with probability, status, and retention recommendation.
5. Dashboard pages provide visual summaries, trends, and insights for business users.

## 🧩 Technologies & Libraries

* Python 3.10
* Streamlit for web UI
* Pandas, NumPy for data processing
* Scikit-learn (and optionally XGBoost / LightGBM) for modelling
* Joblib for model serialization

---

## ✅ Why This Project Matters

* Demonstrates full ML lifecycle from raw data to deployable web application
* Showcases real-world business application (telecom churn) — relevant for hiring portfolios
* Ready to present, share on GitHub, add to your resume or personal website

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Add user authentication for secure access
* Enable batch upload of customer lists (CSV) and automated retention score output
* Integrate with live data source / streaming data
* Extend model to multi-class churn risk tiers and retention offer suggestions
